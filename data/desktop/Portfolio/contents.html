              For this project, the Science Museum of Minnesota was asked to build several exhibit halls
                for their new museum, including the engineering hall pictured here.
              </br>
              Exhibits I personally had a major role in building included:
              <ul>
                <li> the <span>MIDI sound studio</span>, where visitors used a variety of interfaces
                   to control digital and physical instruments.
                </li>
                <li><span>Earthquake Table</span>, which played back real earthquake
                  data on a linear-actuated experiment table.
                </li>
                <li><span>Robot Arena</span>, where visitors used a block programming language,
                  to program arduino-powered robots to navigate a maze.
                </li>
                <li><span>Animation Studio</span>, which allowed visitor to program the movements
                  of robotic sculptures, using the same block programming interface
                  as the robot arena.
                </li>
                <li><span>LED Bicycle Wheel</span>, which allowed visitor to draw an image using a touchscreen
                  program, and have that image displayed on an LED array mounted to a spinning
                  bicycle wheel.
                </li>
              </ul>
            </div>
            <br />
            Most of the programs were written in C++, and communicated with hardware either
            via a serial connection to a microcontroller or through MIDI.

          <h1>CanCan Wonderland</h1>
          <div class='content'>
            <gal-lery src='driveFolderID=0ByMR02VKJZUMYlgxYnVsM2ZkOTA' id='cancan'></gal-lery>
            CanCan Wonderland is an art space/minigolf course built into the old American Can
            Factory in St. Paul, Minnesota. Retrofit took on the production of two of the
            minigolf holes:
            </br>
            <ul>
              <li> <span>Natural Disasters</span>, in which players have to putt around a 14 foot tall
                spinning tornado, across a miniature railroad bridge, and onto a vibrating,
                rocking, earthquake platform where the hole is located. The tornado is powered
                two, 1/7th horsepower AC motors (one to rotate the tornado top, and one to spin
                the rotating platform at the bottom), and the earthquake platform
                is controlled by a custom microcontroller board which activates the
                vibration and rocking based on input from a motion detector. The microcontroller
                also controls the 'lava flow' (addressable strip lights) and smoke machine of the
                adjacent volcano.
              </li>
              <br />
              <br />
              <li><span>Wonderwall</span> is a hole which started as a concept by University of Minnesota
                architecture students, and was realized by Retrofit. It is an eight foot by eigth foot
                translucent wall, made of Lexan greenhouse panels, that streams of water flow down.
                Players putt their ball through small cutouts at the bottom of the panels, and sensors
                detect which cutout the ball passes through. These sensors then trigger a lightshow
                along the top of the wall, based on which cutout had the ball pass through.
              </li>
            </ul>

          <h1>Space, an Out Of Gravity Experience</h1>
          <div class='content'>
            <gal-lery src='driveFolderID=0ByMR02VKJZUMTTR6TlMySVdmY0k' id='space'></gal-lery>
            Space is a touring show for the Science Museum of Minnesota, which focuses on
            the challenges of space exploration, and how humanity is addressing them.
            </br>
            Exhibits I personally had a major role in building included:
            <ul>
              <li> <span>Powering your Spacecraft</span>, a simple game where visitors
                make decisions about how to use power generated by a solar panel,
                in order to survive and complete a mission on a 'space station'. Power is
                generated on a solar panel on the left side of the exhibit, and can be
                used directly to power devices on the interface (right) side of the exhibit,
                or it can be stored to be used when the solar power isn't available.
                As visitors switch devices between solar and battery power, the large display
                above the interface updates the status of the battery packs the critical systems.
                <br />
                This was largely written in HTML/Javascript/NodeJS, and the communication
                with the hardware was done serially through a custom written library.
              </li>
              <br />
              <br />
              <li><span>Servicing Your Spacecraft</span> allows visitors to control a robotic
                arm to pick up a ball, and drop it into a target area. This is done using a
                Thermo Fisher robotic arm, typically used for lab automation. Programming the
                arm to respond to joystick controls was done by writing a native application
                for their controller in Basic. We also designed a battery backup system
                for the arm, so it could return to a home position in the event of a power failure,
                because the arm did not have absolute encoding.
              </li>
              <br />
              <br />
              <li>The <span>Drop Towers</span> are a testbed that allow visitors to drop
                a variety of experiments from a height of 15 feet, which creates a microgravity
                environment for about 1 second. In the drop carriage with the experiment, there
                is a high-speed Vieworks camera, which records the experiment as it falls, so that
                the effects of microgravity can be replayed in slow motion.
                <br />
                The interface for the playback and recording software was written in HTML and javascript,
                inside of an Electron application. In order to utilize the Vieworks API to
                control and access data from the camera, I wrote a Node module in C++, which allows me to
                access my native C++ functions from Javscript.
              </li>
              <br />
              <br />
              <li>The <span>Ion Thruster</span> is a simple model that demonstrates how
                an ion thruster would work to propel a spacecraft without burning a propellent.
                It works by charging the air around a rod with a high voltage, which causes the
                air to accelerate out the back of the model engine, producing thrust.

          <h1>Monterey Bay Aquarium</h1>
          <div class='content'>

            The Monterey Bay Aquarium contracted with the Science Museum of Minnesota
            to build some animated components for their Seabirds gallery in 2017. They needed
            a variety of mechanisms to make 2D cutouts of birds walk, waddle, and flap.
            <br />
            <br />
            As we were building these at a remote location, we produced detailed drawings
            of each of the components, so we could ensure that they were going to meet the client's
            space needs before we began build the components.
            <br />
            <br />
            For these components, I wrote several arduino libraries to control stepper motors
            which were used to drive linear actuators. These libraries enabled me to easily
            program different movement profiles for the different actuators, so we could
            produce a wide array of simulated walks and waddles.

            Escape Inc began working with Retrofit in 2015 to produce props for their escape
            rooms. They were interested in producing some props that would let them using more
            than just padlocks to unlock different parts of their rooms.
            <br />
            <br />
            Some of the most interesting props include:
            <ul>
              <li>The <span>Antidote Dispenser</span> is a cabinet-sized machine which
                pumps fluid from 6 different columns based on touchscreen input from
                the patrons. Once all 6 have been dispensed, the machine opens a linear-actuated
                hatch on the front of the prop, and a canister can be removed, which acts as the
                key to exit the room.
                <br />
                This was largely written in HTML/Javascript as a Chrome App, and the communication
                with the hardware was done serially through a custom written library. The electrical
                control box controls power to a bidirectional pump and solenoid valves on each of
                the tubes, a linear acuator to open the hatch, and a fog machine which engages when
                the hatch is opened.
              </li>
              <br />
              <br />
              <li>The <span>Retinal Scanner</span> is a wall mounted device which simulates a
                stylized retinal scan. An arduino reads an RFID chip inside
                a dismembered eyeball, when it is held to the device. This causes a laser to scan
                across the acrylic panel, and once this is completed, it releases a magnetic
                lock on the adjacent door.
              </li>
              <br />
              <br />
              <li>The <span>Lab Equipment Tower</span> is a large rack of old lab equipment,
                which, when the knobs and buttons are set to a particular combination, releases
                a magnetic lock on a door in the room.
              </li>
              <br />
              <br />
              <li>The <span>RFID Hacker</span> is a small Pelican case which contains a 7 inch
                touchscreen and Raspberry Pi with a battery backup system. It can plug into a
                fake, wall-mounted RFID reader (via a USB cable) which powers the device and charges
                the battery. Once plugged in, the Raspberry Pi turns on, and shows a user interface
                to the patrons. Once they answer a set of questions in the interface, the Pi triggers
                a relay in the RFID reader which unlocks a door. Written in Electron.
